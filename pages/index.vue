        Hi! I'm <strong>Delena Malan</strong>, a full-stack software engineer,
        from beautiful Cape Town, South Africa. I currently work at a consulting
        company called
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/fluenty-it/">Fluenty IT</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've dabbled high and low in different programming languages, frameworks
        and industries. Currently I mostly work with Laravel and VueJS and I try
        to keep my Python skills up to date. I also sometimes code work with
        Ruby on Rails and NodeJS.
      </p>
      <p>
        My other interests span non-fiction books, films, music, cooking,
        podcasts and playing soccer. I am an explorer of ideas and love
        questioning the status quo.
      </p>
